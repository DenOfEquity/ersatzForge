a backup of my local (experimental, opinionated) changes to Forge2 webUI

* auto selection of VAE and text encoders per model / UI setting
* Chroma (based on https://github.com/croquelois/forgeChroma)
* extended Checkpoint Merger
* Hypernetworks
* various other minor tweaks: UI, embedding filtering, code consolidation, dead code removal
* tiling (sd1, 2, xl) (based on https://github.com/spinagon/ComfyUI-seamless-tiling)
